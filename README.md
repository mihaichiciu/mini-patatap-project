# Mini Patatap Clone

This is a mini Patatap clone. On any letter keypress a circle is generated with a specific radius and a random color.

It gets smaller at a given rate, changes color during the process and it is deleted when it is too small to be seen.

Every letter key has its unique sound played on the keypress event.
